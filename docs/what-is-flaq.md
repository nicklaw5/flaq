# What is Flaq?

## Synopsis

Flaq *(a working title)* is a website that connects higher tier eSports players with lower tier players, to provide group or one-on-one based video game coaching. That is, higher tier players provide coaching services to lower tier player in exchange for a monetary fee.

## How would it work?

There would basically be three different services that are offered on Flaq:

- One-on-one coaching;
- Group-based coaching (2-6 people); and
- Seminars (6-50 people).

Seminars offer a more generalist approach to tutoring, and are aimed at lower tier, entry level players. These sessions generally last anywhere between 30-90 minutes, and mainly focus on one particular topic. For example, a tutor might decide to provide a CS:GO session on how to throw and place smoke grenades accurately, as well as showing the different kinds of smokes on each map. Similarly, a tutor running a LoL seminar may decide to focus on teaching students how to effectively play [Jungle](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Jungling). Seminars, in this sense, would be held much like they are in person: the person running the seminar would talk for a period of time on the topic at hand, and at the end would invite those listening to ask questions.

## Competition & Product Differentiation

#### Who are the current competitors in this market and what do they offer?

**Twitch ([twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/))**

As one of the largest players in the eSports industry, Twitch is one to be reckoned with. Twitch doesn't offer a product or service for connecting students with mentors, but does offer live streams, as well as VODs, where viewers can learn by watching, or even be tutored by prominent eSports figures. A lot of eSports professionals use Twitch as a source of income, to substitute their livelihood. Or perhaps the teams they are associated with have contractual agreements of them to live stream semi-regularly.

Twitch also offers a live chat where viewers can interact with the streamer in real-time, which is one of it's biggest selling points.

In addition to this, streamers commonly accept donations from viewers so that those donating can share their gratitude to the streamer, but more often than not, so that they may ask a questions of the streamer. This is common for more popular streamers, where most of the questions that get asked in the live chat are either ignored or missed by the streamer.

**YouTube ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/))**

Whilst YouTube does not offer a product or service for connecting tutors with students, it does offer what can be seen as free tutoring through the vast, and seemingly endless amount of tutorial-like video content. But whilst a viewer can engage with the content provider by leaving a comment on a video, it is rare to see discussion flourish beyond a single sentence response, if a response at all. Perhaps it's the physical effort of typing out a response that deters potential respondents. Or perhaps the question/comment goes unread, and therefore unanswered.

**Xsolla eSports Academy ([xsolla.academy](https://xsolla.academy/))**

This site looks to be a tried and failed version of the one-on-one coaching model. The company behind it, [Xsolla](https://xsolla.com/), offers a number of products that appear to focus primary on the gaming industry, specifically on payment handling. (It should be note that Xsolla is Twitch's payment handling partner.) The reason it appears to have failed, is simply due to the inactivity the site's forum. One would think that if the site gained enough traction, there would be a considerable number discussions. That does not seem the case. There does, however, appear to be a large number of registered coaches. So it is somewhat unknown as to the level of success the site has had.

As for the site itself, it seems to offer somewhat of an interesting monetisation approach. In addition to students being able to book one-on-one sessions with coaches, students are also able to subscribe (monthly) to previously recorded sessions. This is very similar to the way Twitch allows broadcasters to make past VODs and highlights only available to subscribers. Once a session it booked and payment has been taken, it's left to the coach and student to coordinate how the session will proceed. There appears to be the functionality for private messaging from within the site.

**Gamer Sensei ([gamersensei.com](https://www.gamersensei.com/))**

Gamer Sensei appears to be one of the more professionally looking eSports coaching sites available. It also appears to rank high in Google rankings. The site has a lower number of coaches available to select from, but of higher quality tier, mainly professionals from various eSport games. This is due to the extreme vetting they undertake when considering a user's application to become a coach. The site picked up [$2.3 million in seed funding](http://www.vcnewsdaily.com/gamer-sensei/venture-capital-funding/nmfjnkllxy) back in June 2016 from a number of venture companies, such as [Accomplice](https://accomplice.co/), [Boston Seed Capital](http://www.bostonseed.com/) and [Corigin Ventures](http://coriginventures.com/). Then, in Dec 2016 the company acquired [dotacoach.org](https://dotacoach.org/) for an [undisclosed amount](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161208005575/en/Gamer-Sensei-Acquires-DotaCoach-Expand-Leadership-Position).

Gamers Sensei appears to only offer one service: one-on-one coaching sessions. They advertise that they use *"... patent pending technology that connects players with the worldâ€™s largest collection of professional, certified sensei across all major esports titles"*. Students are able to purchase "points", a form of site currency, which can then be used to book coaching sessions.

It would beneficial to know more about the "patent pending technology" that this company is pursing. For more information about Gamer Sensei, see [their About page](https://www.gamersensei.com/about).

#### How does Flaq differentiate from the competition already working in this market?

The goal of Flaq is not to stray too far from what other eSports tutoring services have in place, but to diversify upon the market and it's existing familiarity. Most existing competition in this space offers the ability for those seeking a tutor and for those seeking to tutor, to find each other. They also offer a secure environment for which the monetary transaction that are associated with these tutoring sessions can take place, for which the service provider takes a small percentage. However, this seems to be the extent to which they fulfil their role in these types of negotiations. Once the tutor and their student(s) have become acquainted, it is left to them on how to proceed with tutoring session. This would generally entail all participants coordinating to meet on Skype, or another third-party video/voice/messaging application.

## Monetisation

Coaching session fees will be stipulated by the coach, and a 10-20% fee will be collected by Flaq for any transaction.
