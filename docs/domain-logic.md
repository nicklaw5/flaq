## Signing Up

Signing up to Flaq is relatively straightforward. All that is required is a valid email address and password.

Options for signing up with third-party accounts could include, but are not limited to:

- Twitch
- Steam
- Facebook
- Battlenet

Some of these services will provide details as to whether the email address that the user has supplied has been validated or not. If it hasn't been validated, or the user has signed up by simply providing their email address, an account verification email will need to be sent and actioned by the user before any tutoring session can be placed.

## Games

Initially Flaq would be released as a BETA that would roughly last 6-8 months. During this time business assumptions would be tested and validated. It's important that during this period we do not offer too many games for which tutors can teach. We should limit the availability of game to four of the the following:

- League of Legends
- Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
- Heartstone
- Dota 2
- Overwatch
- Starcraft 2

Once the BETA state has concluded we can offer additional games for tutoring.

## One-on-one Coaching

Once a tutor has connected with their students, there's nothing stopping them from organising coaching sessions, and making payment for those sessions outside of Flaq. The goal here is to provide a fluid transition from the initial booking all the way through the of the session. This might look something like the following:

```
          Student books a timeslot (no payment required)
                              |
                              v
        Tutor accepts booking (requests payment of student)
                              |
                              v
          Student pays for booking (booking confirmed)
                              |
                              v
        Both student and tutor receive confirmation emails
                              |
                              v
      30-60 mins before session start, an email and/or text
      message can be sent to both parties reminding them of
     tutoring sessions. This email/text would include a link
     to a private Discord channel where both parties can meet.
                              |
                              v
                       Sessions starts


                            ||||||
        (We need a way to confirm a session took place,
    in case there is a dispute that gets placed against the
     booking payment. The best option for this is unknown at
             this point and requires more thought.)
                            ||||||


                        Sessions ends
                              |
                              v
               Tutor marks session as completed
                              |
                              v
            Student leaves a review of the session

```

## Communication Between Tutor & Students

*TODO*

## Payment

Payment for sessions would at first be confined to PayPal, but the intention would be to open this to other payment options such as credit card.
